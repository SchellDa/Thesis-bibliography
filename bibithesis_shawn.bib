% BiBTeX-database for D*-Analysis,
% contains also some general stuff about H1-event kinematics,
% photon and proton structure etc.
 
%recommendations:
% 1. German words (besides titles!) like 'Kollaboration' not in
%     database, only in the beginning as 'string'-declaration!
% 1a.No german package things like '"a'! Use '\"a' instead!
% 2. Write english titles with capital letters
%          (besides 'the', 'in' etc.)!
% 3. Use full names of journals!
% 4. Keywords should contain a number, usually the year!
% 5. If the title is not so clear, please add the field
%     'OPTannote' with a short description of the literatur
%        or the reason, why it was added!
% ---> to be discussed
